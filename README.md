## Description

This is simply a notepad, similar but simpler than the one that comes with nearly every OS

## Guide

It works the same way as every other text editor. You can write with your keyboard, highlight text etc.

You also have a couple of options at the top of the screen, with which you can open files, save files, change the font and more!
